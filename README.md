# Hangman-Game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The game typically begins with one player selecting a word and indicating its length using dashes or underscores. The other player then guesses letters one at a time, aiming to uncover the hidden word. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman's gallows or a stick figure is drawn, symbolizing a limb or body part. If the player guesses the word correctly before completing the hangman, they win; otherwise, the game ends when the hangman is fully drawn, resulting in the player's loss.

Hangman is often played as a paper-and-pencil game but has also been adapted into digital formats, including computer games and mobile apps. In digital versions, graphics and animations enhance the visual representation of the hangman, adding to the game's appeal. The words chosen for the game can vary widely, including common words, phrases, or even specialized categories such as movie titles, animals, or countries. Hangman not only entertains but also helps improve vocabulary, spelling, and deductive reasoning skills, making it a popular choice for educational purposes as well as leisure entertainment. Its simplicity and accessibility have ensured its enduring popularity across generations.
